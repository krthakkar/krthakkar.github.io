I am a doctoral candidate in Economics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My research interests are in empirical corporate finance as well as macroeconomics, with topics primarily in bankruptcy, non-financial firm financing and fiscal policy. I will be on the job market this academic year.
