<!-- Praveen Punia
===== -->
I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Marketing at the University of Houston, specializing in selling, sales interactions, and salesforce incentives. My research focuses on understanding how career transitions impact life satisfaction and well-being, as well as studying livestreaming behavior and its implications for sales and marketing strategies. I explore various aspects of salesperson performance and motivation.

As an empirical researcher, I employ a blend of empirical analysis and theoretical frameworks to investigate the dynamics of salesforce management and consumer behavior. By leveraging econometric methods and data analysis, I aim to provide actionable insights that can inform both academic discourse and practical applications in the field of marketing. My methodological approach involves the use of econometric models to analyze large datasets, allowing for the identification of key patterns and trends that impact salesforce effectiveness and consumer behavior.

In terms of academic contributions, I have actively participated in the Winter AMA conferences, serving as a reviewer in 2023 and 2024, and presenting my work in 2024. My presentations at these conferences have focused on the implications of livestreaming behavior for sales strategies and the impact of career transitions on salesforce performance. Additionally, I have taught the Introduction to Marketing Analytics course, where I integrated data-driven insights to enhance students' understanding of marketing principles. My teaching philosophy centers on interactive learning, inclusivity, and relevance, ensuring that course materials are clear, concise, and relatable for all students.

Prior to joining the University of Houston, I worked as a Research Associate in Marketing at the Indian School of Business. In this role, I conducted research on various marketing topics, contributing to several academic publications and industry reports. I hold a Master's degree in Financial Economics from the University of Hyderabad, India, where I developed a strong foundation in quantitative analysis and economic theory.
